## Stakeholders

### Arnee Wen
An NYU student who used to take hand-written notes on paper but now takes notes on iPad.
#### Goals/Needs:
<ol>
<li>I want to be able to share my notes online in whatever format I want, pictures or PDF.</li>
<li>I want to be able to search for notes that other people have uploaded.</li>
<li>I want to be able to filter out notes based on the class, course or even the teacher the notes are associated with.</li>
<li>I want to know how reliable the notes I am getting are and how useful they are to other people.</li>
</ol>

#### Problems/Frustrations:
<ol>
<li>Quality of notes online is a big issue, I would like some way to tell if the notes are of good quality.</li>
<li>  Simply getting notes from people who’ve taken a class before isn’t enough to make the notes usable, I sometimes need more explanation.</li>
<li>Sometimes getting a peer’s notes for a class I missed is impossible because I don’t know anyone in large classes or the class is online and not recorded.</li>
<li>My notes can sometimes be misplaced since I write on paper so it would be nice if it was possible to have them be digitized.</li>
</ol>

## Product Vision Statement

A university-focused, social, note-sharing mobile application where students can upload, share and review each other’s notes by searching for notes using specific filters, such as professors, classes and subjects.
